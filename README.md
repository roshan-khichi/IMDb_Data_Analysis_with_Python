# 🎬 Movie & TV Show Data Analysis with Python
## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates web scraping + data analysis + visualization using Python.
I scraped IMDb Movie/TV Show data (titles, ratings, genres, actors, runtime, etc.), cleaned it with Pandas, and explored interesting insights such as:

- Top-rated movies by genre
- Most successful actors and directors
- Movie release trends over the years
- Runtime and rating correlations

The project also includes interactive visualizations and can be extended into a Movie Recommendation System or Review Sentiment Analyzer.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Web scraping of IMDb movie/TV show data using BeautifulSoup / Requests
✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn
✅ Insights like:

  - Top 10 movies per genre
  - Highest-rated actors/directors
  - Trends in movie releases

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3

Libraries:

- pandas → Data analysis
- requests / BeautifulSoup → Web scraping
- matplotlib / seaborn → Visualization

## 📊 Example Visualizations
